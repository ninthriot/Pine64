Accessing GPIO Pins from the Shell in Debian
(# refers to the GPIO# on the system, not necesarily the pin number on the board)
1. Either become root or chmod the directory sys/class/gpio
2. Navigate to sys/class/gpio and register the pin for use:   echo # > export 
       Note: You don't know the # then take a look at GPIO-numebrs.html
3. Navigate to sys/class/gpio/#: echo out > direction
4. echo 1 > value
5. The pin should now be HIGH on output.
      To remove the GPIO pin from the GPIO directory, simply: echo # > unexport
